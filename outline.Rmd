## What's this project about?

The main purpose of the project is to calculate two outcome variables indicating human **joint-joint coordination** and **variability of coordination** during body movement. These two variables ared called *inter-joint continuous relative phase (CRP)* and *deviation phase (DP)*, respectily. They are widely used in the field of biomechanics, but to our knowlege there is no R function/package avalible designed for it.

## Description of the data source (must be publicly available)

### Description of data

The testing data was collected in the Motion Analysis Lab at UO. Five participants were recruited. They were asked to perform level walking on a 15-m straight walkway for a couple times. A 12-camera motion analysis system with a set of 40 reflective markers was used to record the whole body movement during walking. From the marker trajectories, 3-D human model was created and **joint data** was then calculated for further analysis.  

### Glimpse of data

```{r}
df <- import(here::here("data", "F01pre_single_kinematic.txt"),
             setclass = "tbl_df", skip = 5) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

head(df)
```

(needs more descriptioin here. how many trials? what's names of each column? how many rows?)============================

### Tentative steps 

1. Tidy data  
(how so?)=============================  

2. Calculate CRP of hip-knee
  + Built phase portrait: plotting the normalized angular positions $\Theta$ (x-axis) and normalized angular velocities $\omega_{i}$ (y-axis). Angular positions and velocities were normalized using the following equations, where $\Theta_{i}$ and $\omega_{i}$ are the angular position and velocity for 101 data points during a walking cycle.  
  
  $$\Theta_{i}=\frac{2*[\Theta_{i}-min(\Theta_{i})]}{max(\Theta_{i})-min(\Theta_{i})}-1$$
  $$\omega_{i}=\frac{\omega_{i}}{max(\omega_{i})} $$  
  
  + Calculate phase angles($\varphi$):  calculated using the below equation φ=tan−1(ω/θ) along each data point and unwrapped to correct discontinuities occurred during angle computation.  
  
  $$\varphi = \tan^{-1}(\frac{\omega}{\theta }) $$
  
  + Calculate CRP: obtained by subtracting the phase angles of distal joint from that of proximal joint as follows. CRP identifies the coordination between two adjacent joints.
  
  $$CRP_{hip\cdot knee}=\varphi_{hip} - \varphi_{knee}$$
 
 
3. Calculate CRP of knee-ankle joint: repeating the above steps along with the following equation. 
 $$CRP_{knee\cdot ankle}=\varphi_{knee} - \varphi_{ankle}$$
  
4. Calculate DP: assessed with the average value of all standard deviations calculated for each data point over a walking cycle from five CRP curves as follows.  


$$mean(std(CRP_{i}))$$  

5. Print the CRP (1-array vector) and DP (value), and plot results like this.

6. Repeat step 1 to step 5 for five subjects.



## Lingering questions (is there anything that gives you pause in terms of how your final project will address all the grading requirements)
